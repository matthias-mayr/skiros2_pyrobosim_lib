# Problem 2 - Waste Disposal
**Recap**:
* In [0_Start.md](0_Start.md) we learned about the primitive skills and compound skills.  
* In [1 Problem 1 Object Fetch.md](1_Problem_1_Object_Fetch.md) we learned how to build a behavior tree (BT) from multiple skills.

In this problem, we are going to throw waste items into a large bin:
| Goal | Initial State | SkiROS2 Skills | Notes |

```python
class problem_2(SkillBase):
