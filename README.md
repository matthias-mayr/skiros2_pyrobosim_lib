###  SkiROS2 pyrobosim Library

A warm welcome to the SkiROS2 setup for the [problems of the deliberation group ROSCon24 workshop](https://github.com/ros-wg-delib/roscon24-workshop). This repository contains skills and knowledge representation for the started problem. Among the skills are wrapper skills for `pyrobosim` actions as well as skeletons to solve the problems and their solutions.

**SkiROS2** is a platform to create complex robot behaviors by composing _skills_ - modular software blocks - into [behavior trees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior_tree_(artificial_intelligence,_robotics_and_control)).

Robots coordinated with SkiROS can be used in partially structured environments, where the robot has a good initial understanding of the environment, but it is also expected to find discrepancies, fail using initial plans and react accordingly.

SkiROS offers the following features:

* A **framework** to organize the **robot behaviors** within **modular skill libraries**
* Scalable skill model with **pre-, hold- and post-conditions**
* A **reactive execution engine** based on **Behavior trees**
* A **world model** as a **semantic database** to manage environmental knowledge
* **Reasoning capabilities** and **automatic inference** of skill parameters
* An integration point for **PDDL task planning**
* **Automatic generation of planning domains** based on the skills and entities in the world model
* **ROS**, **RViz** and **tf integration**
* **Python APIs** for skill handling, the world model and task planning

## Getting Started with SkiROS2 as a Whole

* **A full introduction and the tutorials are located in the [SkiROS2 wiki](https://github.com/RVMI/skiros2/wiki)**
* Watch a video from the [video section below](#Videos)
* Additionally, the [SkiROS2 paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.17030) provides an overview and background information

### Videos
We have video introductions to the platform with varying lengths. Feel free to choose depending on your time budget. The longer ones always include the content of the short ones.

## How to get Started with the pyrobosim Problems
You can launch SkiROS2 together with pyrobosim with this command:
```sh
ros2 launch skiros2_pyrobosim_lib main.launch.py problem_number:=1
```

This brings up the SkiROS2 interface as well as the pyrobosim world. As a first thing, it is a good browse through the available skills and the world model. You can do this with the SkiROS2 interface or by looking at the files in the `skiros2_pyrobosim_lib` package.

### View Solutions

We include the solutions to all problems in this repository. We assume that you have an interest to solve the problems yourself, but if you're stuck and want to see the robot move, you can load the solution of a given problem with:
```sh
ros2 launch skiros2_pyrobosim_lib main.launch.py load_only_solutions:=True problem_number:=1
```

This loads the set of solution skills that are in [skiros2_pyrobosim_lib/solutions.py](skiros2_pyrobosim_lib/solutions.py).
